# Accessible Web Design & Development Guidance
This draft contains guidance for meeting the Revised 508 Standards for Web sites and was created by the ACOP technical workgroup . The purpose was to identify requirements that are the responsibility of a developer and requirements that are more likely to be the responsibility of a site's designer.

The ACOP working group wanted to configure guidance so that viewers can find information easily. A listing of WCAG Success Criteria according to criterion number ing (1.2.1, 1.2.2, etc.) was determined to be undesirable.

The working group agreed to the categories of content as shown in the side navigation menu. These categories align with updates to the Baseline Tests for Revised 508 Standards. The Baseline Tests cover all WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA requirements and will be the basis of the updated Trusted Tester Test Process.
